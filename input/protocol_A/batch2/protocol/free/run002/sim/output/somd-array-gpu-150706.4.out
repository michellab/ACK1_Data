optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -C [CONFIG], --config [CONFIG]
                        Supply an optional CONFIG file to control the
                        calculation.
  -H, --help-config     Get additional help regarding all of the parameters
                        (and their default values) that can be set in the
                        optionally-supplied CONFIG file
  --author              Get information about the authors of this script.
  --version             Get version information about this script.
  -t [TOPOLOGY_FILE], --topology_file [TOPOLOGY_FILE]
                        The Amber topology file containing the system.
  -c [COORDINATE_FILE], --coordinate_file [COORDINATE_FILE]
                        The Amber coordinate file giving the coordinates of
                        all of the atoms in the passed topology file.
  -m [MORPH_FILE], --morph_file [MORPH_FILE]
                        The morph file describing the single topology
                        calculation to be performed.
  -d [DEVICE], --device [DEVICE]
                        The device ID of the GPU on which you want to run the
                        simulation.
  -n [NMOVES], --nmoves [NMOVES]
                        The number of Molecular Dynamics moves you want to
                        run.
  -p [PLATFORM], --platform [PLATFORM]
                        The OpenMM platform on which you want to run the
                        simulation.
  -l [LAMBDA_VAL], --lambda_val [LAMBDA_VAL]
                        The lambda value at which you want to run the
                        simulation.
