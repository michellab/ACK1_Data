Each directory contains the input files used for each of the protocol esssayed. Inside each directory you will find the following sub-directories:

1. fesetup: Contains input files and structures to use FESetup to prepare complex, ligand and protein, and to morph between ligands essayed in each batch. The *.sh files are the scripts to be sent to the queue system and should be adapted according to your queue management program. The input files called from the script are named setup-ligand_number.in, and you can use the command "FEsetup setup-ligand_number.in" to run that input file in command line. Afterwards you need to use the command "FEsetup morph.in" to morph between ligands in each batch.

2. protocol: Contains files used for the automation scripts in folder run

3. run: After having run all of FESetup the simulation input can be generated by running: bash setupall.sh followed by bash run1all.sh. Adjustements will have to be made in these scripts to fit each individual cluster.
bash run1all.sh Adjustments will have to be made in these scripts to fit each indivual cluster
